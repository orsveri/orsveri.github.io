    "\n",
    "This is an article from the series about statistics (and probability theory). The motivation behind this series is to retain knowledge while taking courses, reading books and articles. I write articles about something that I missed before, found interesting or possibly useful to me in the future. These articles do not constitute a course, they are just a collection of my personal study notes or summaries on different topics related to statistics.\n",

    "* **discrete** random variable - can take on a finite number of distinct values, probability distribution function is defined as ***probability mass function***. Example: the number of kids in a family.\n",
